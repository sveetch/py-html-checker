Install with all features: ::

    pip install py-html-checker[cli,jinja,serve]

If you don't plan to use it from command line (like as a module), HTML
export and HTTP server you can avoid the ``cli``, ``jinja`` and ``serve``
parts: ::

    pip install py-html-checker

For development usage see :ref:`development_install`.
